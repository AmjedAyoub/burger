# Eat-Da-Burger

## Overview
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.\
Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page with a `Delete it!` button. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
